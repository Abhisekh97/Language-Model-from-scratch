# Language-Model-from-scratch
This is Python Notebook using google colab where i have implemented a very basic language model . The task is to generate New names from a set training example. Training example contains Names of children and task is to train a language model which can produce human like names. 


1. In the implementation i have used bigram language model. Bigram language Model is a very basic and probablistic model and the results generated from it are not Good.

2. Further improvement can be done using some advanced language models .
